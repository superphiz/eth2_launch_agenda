# This is a general template for  hosting Ethereum 2 launch calls

## Call duration is 1 hour

* Start call 20 minutes before genesis block

* Describe the global concept of Ethereum 2, describe the phases

* Discussion of the history and teams involved in phase 0

* Introduce every client launching with genesis

* a few minutes prior to launch: timer clock to countdown to 0, eth2stats showing beacon chain nodes

* View 30 seconds before genesis block: all client beacon nodes, look for initial sync

* After verifying that blocks are syncing: switch to validator views

* look for common root hashes to confirm interoperability

* refer to beaconcha.in status (and/or other explorers)

* 12 minutes in, epoch 1 will conclude, but it's based on genesis

* 24 minutes in, epoch 2 will justify

* Monitor finalization percentage 

* 36 minutes in, epoch 3 will justify

* Wrap up includes a description of what happened and what it means for the future.
